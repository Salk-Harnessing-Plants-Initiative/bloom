"""Tool-agnostic plot helpers shared by PCA, UMAP, and future analysis tools.

Callers build a ``resolved_calls`` dict of zero-arg callables — one per plot
key — each wrapping a plotter call with its bespoke args.  This module then
validates, dispatches, and cleans up without knowing anything about the
caller's result type or the upstream plotter's API.

Follows the ``_qc_shared`` precedent: pure validation + dispatch logic,
importable with no live stack and no matplotlib import at module level.
