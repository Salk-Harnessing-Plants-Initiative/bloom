## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: ExperimentReader Port

The system SHALL define a backend-agnostic `ExperimentReader` port exposing `load_experiment(name, version, require_clean)` and `list_experiments()`, where `load_experiment` returns an `ExperimentFrame` carrying the experiment frame, **adapter-declared** column roles (trait vs metadata columns), and a source label. Column roles SHALL be declared by the adapter, not re-inferred by callers, so a future adapter sourcing tidy/long rows can satisfy the contract without reproducing dtype-based detection. Consumers SHALL depend only on this port — never on `supabase`, `experiment_utils`, or `storage/` primitives directly — for reading experiment data.

#### Scenario: Load an experiment returns a frame with declared roles

- **WHEN** a consumer calls `load_experiment(name)` (default `version="latest"`) for a known experiment
- **THEN** it returns an `ExperimentFrame` whose frame holds the experiment data, whose trait and metadata column roles are populated, and whose source label identifies what was resolved (e.g. `raw`, `legacy_cleaned`, or a versioned cleaned output)

#### Scenario: Version selection resolves in the deployed order

- **WHEN** `load_experiment(name, version="latest")` is called and a versioned `qc_<stem>` manifest with a `latest` cleaned output exists
- **THEN** the reader resolves outputs in the deployed order — versioned-manifest `latest` cleaned CSV, then the legacy un-versioned `qc_<stem>/<stem>_cleaned.csv`, then the raw input — returning the first that resolves

#### Scenario: Explicit version miss is a hard error

- **WHEN** `load_experiment(name, version="v9")` is called for a version that does not exist
- **THEN** the reader signals a not-found condition for that explicit version rather than silently falling back to another tier

#### Scenario: Clean-required load

- **WHEN** `load_experiment(name, require_clean=True)` is called and no cleaned output exists
- **THEN** the reader signals that a cleaned version is required and absent, rather than returning the raw frame

#### Scenario: Unknown experiment is reported through the contract

- **WHEN** `load_experiment(name)` is called for a name the reader cannot resolve in any tier
- **THEN** the reader surfaces a structured not-found condition with no raw Supabase or filesystem traceback, bucket name, or connection string leaked to the caller

#### Scenario: List experiments enumerates available inputs

- **WHEN** a consumer calls `list_experiments()`
- **THEN** it returns the available experiments (each identified by name) and returns an empty list — not an error — when none are available

#### Scenario: Surviving read consumers move to their section homes intact

- **WHEN** the surviving core discovery tools (`list_available_experiments`, `load_experiment_data`, `list_existing_analyses`) are relocated into the `core` section
- **THEN** their read behaviour is preserved (they resolve experiments via `experiment_utils` / the injected reader exactly as before the move), and none newly introduces a direct `supabase` / `AnalysisWriter` import beyond what the pre-change tool already used

#### Scenario: The deleted cross-experiment local-CSV read path is gone

- **WHEN** the tree is inspected after the change
- **THEN** `correlation_tools.py` and `tools/workflows/*` (the former holders of the deprecated `BLOOM_TRAITS_DIR` cross-experiment local-CSV read) SHALL be absent, so no consumer retains that direct-read path, and no surviving module imports a deleted vendored analysis module
